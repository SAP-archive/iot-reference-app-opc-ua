# Thing, Device and OPC UA Model

We knew, we had to come up with an approach to map concepts in the thing model and in the opc ua model and to then also make sure we can transmit data via the device model.

We started from the thing model which is the basis for analysing the data from a kettle and for building applications around its data.  Our observations are in [notes on thing modeler](note_on_thing_modeler.md).

Then we looked at how can we map this into an opc ua model. The powerpoint shows how different things map to each other: [mapping](Data_modeling_across_Components.pptx).
