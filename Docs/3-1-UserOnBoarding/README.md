## User On-Boarding

To create a new user for the kettle monitor app follow the below steps:

1. Make sure you know, that the person who requested access is entitled to see the information. Ask him for his first name, last name and email address.

2. As an Administrator of the app to go to https://refapps.iot-sap.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/launchpage/#BusinessPartners-admin?app=Persons&/persons

3. Create a new user and make sure he is assigned to

	3a. user group: "kettle_monitor" (USER: set status to active. Enter email )

	3b. authorization group: default.

4. Send an email to the user and give him the following information:

		You will get an email from notification@sapnetworkmail.com which will ask you to set your password. Once you have done this you can access the help page and from it the application at https://refappsorg-dev-kettlemonitor4.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/kettlemonitor4/webapp/help.html. You might want to bookmark this link. If you have questions or issues please get back to me.

To test the above process we on-boarded each other in the team and used an incognito window to check, that the new user would work and also that the new user would not have full access to the Thing Modeler (e.g. that he could not see other persons or that he could not create a thing.)
