## Establish First Use Case and Scope

The trigger for the whole project was when we talked to the head of SAP Facilities and he told us, that the biggest machines, in regards of power consumption, are the cooking kettle. He would think, that if we could monitor the current consumed by them we could detect quite a few things and come up with useful use cases.

The first use case he mentioned was, that inside of the kettle there are more then 10 heating elements, each connected to one of the 3 phases of the 400V alternating current. If one of them breaks the current consumed on this phase would go down. If more then 2 break then cooking is slowed down and it should be repaired, but it often goes unnoticed for some time.

We documented the use case here: [use case diagram in ppt](UseCaseDiagram-KettleMonitoring.pptx).
