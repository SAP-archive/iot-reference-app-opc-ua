## First Integration Test

We used a fan and a split up power cable to test everything end-to-end in the lab.

Once this was done we felt comfortable enough putting one device into production use by authorised persons to handle high voltage electricity.

We were forced to repeat this test but as it was manual we had a lot of manual effort for the test-setup. For continuing this we would probably have limited tests with real hardware (e.g. using test rigs or robots for automation of the hardware tests) and then use simulations of the hardware to test the software.

Later we added a physical test device that would send generated simulated data which would allow to test more continuously. this helped a lot with the ongoing testing and keeping the real device up and running.
