## First Integration Test

We used a fan and a split up power cable to test everything end-to-end in the lab.

Once this was done we felt comfortable enough putting one device into production use by authorized persons to handle high voltage electricity.

We were forced to repeat this test but as it was manual we had a lot of manual effort or we did not do it which led to other headaches.

Later we added a physical test device that would send generated simulated data which would allow to test more continously.
