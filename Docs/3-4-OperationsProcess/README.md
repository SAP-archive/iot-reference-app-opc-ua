## Operations Processes

We will need to make sure that our application is up and running and if not react accordingly. We also have to provide support if the application has an issue.

## Regular Tasks:
1. Renew the whitelisting of the mac address of the pi in the guest wifi for all devices in the operations checklist

## Maintenance of the device

You can use Yaler (see landscape folder) to connect remotely to the device. If this does not work you can also connect to the second ethernet port (eth1) with a wire from your laptop. If you change your network configuration on your laptop to have a static ip address (e.g. 192.168.200.77) then you can connect to the siemens device using ssh root@192.168.200.1.

If the siemens device is not responding to anything you might want to unplug the power at the top (the low voltage supply can be simply unplugged and plugged back in - it does not need to be unscrewed).
